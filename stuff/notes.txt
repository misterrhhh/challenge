There are two teams:
- Radiant
- Dire

In the beginning, teams must ban and pick the heroes.
Each team has to ban 7 heroes and pick 5 (one for each player)

Each team has:
- 20 seconds to individually ban (+ bonus time);
- 30 seconds to individually pick (+ bonus time)

- ~2:10 minutes of bonus time 

At the end, each team decides which players will play which heroes. 
The game starts when the draft is finished.
